        <h3><a name="api" class="anchor" href="#api"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>API Reference Documentation</h3>
        <p>The QtStereoscopy module provides support for a multitude of stereoscopic display devices to Qt applications. The module's API reference documentation can be found <a href="api/qtstereoscopy-module.html">here</a>.</p>

        <h3><a name="requirements" class="anchor" href="#requirements"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirements</h3>
        <p>QtStereoscopy extends functionality added to the revised <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qtgui-index.html">QtGui</a> module introduced in Qt5. As such, prior versions of the Qt library are not supported. While the new QtGui module provides a modern way of using the OpenGL API, it is still relatively new (as of September 2014) and a few features that exist in prior versions of Qt are still not fully implemented. One such feature is a set of API calls that allows for access to the native display device (required by the Oculus SDK, for example). The current workaround is to use a part of the <a href="http://qt-project.org/wiki/Qt-Platform-Abstraction">Qt Platform Abstraction</a> (QPA) which is currently strongly-coupled to the version of Qt it is built against. Ergo, this is not a portable solution but will very likely become one as the QPA API matures.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the C++11 standard is heavily used. It stands to reason that a compiler that implements the said standard, at least, is necessary.</p>

        <h3><a name="installing-qtstereoscopy" class="anchor" href="#installing-qtstereoscopy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing QtStereoscopy</h3>
        <p>QtStereoscopy's build process is still not tied to Qt which means the usual way a Qt module is integrated into a project will not work. Instead, it relies on a set of project include files (*.pri), each of which specifies the build configuration for a specific set of stereoscopic display devices.</p>
        <p>Start by cloning the qtstereoscopy project then include one or more project include files (found in the <code>install</code> directory) to a project file (*.pro). For example, to add support for Oculus VR devices, prepend <code>include(&lt;/path/to/qtstereoscopy&gt;/install/oculusvr.pri)</code> where <code>&lt;/path/to/qtstereoscopy&gt;</code> is qtstereoscopy's location.</p>
        <p>Once this is done, simply include the header files (see <a href="#api">API documentation</a>) into your project, like you would a regular Qt module; the build process will take care of the rest.</p>
